# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge for UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp

The goal of this challenge is to create a number of tables (dataframes), each of which have specific criteria, as well as a written report.

- DATA ANALYSIS - 

Contained in the 'PyCitySchools' folder is the Jupyter notebook 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' which includes the main script to run the analysis.

In the 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' notebook are nine summary tables (or dataframes).

Summary tables included in 'PyCitySchools.ipynb':
1. Local Government Area Summary
2. School Summary
3. Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
4. Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
5. Maths Scores by Year
6. Reading Scores by Year
7. Scores by School Spending
8. Scores by School Size
9. Scores by School Type

The 'Resources' folder contains the datasets used for the analysis:
1. schools_complete.csv
2. students_complete.csv

I have included headings (markdowns) which denote the beginning of each section.

At the end of each section is the summary table (dataframe) which displays the data as required.

- WRITTEN REPORT -

A written report called 'PyCitySchools_Written_Report.plaintext' can be found in the 'PyCitySchools' folder.

This written report summarises the analysis and draws conclusions from the calculations in 'PyCitySchools.ipynb'.
